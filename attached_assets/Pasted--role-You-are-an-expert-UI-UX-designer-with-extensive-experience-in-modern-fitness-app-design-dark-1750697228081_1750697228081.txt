<task>
Fix the visual design and color scheme of the Exercise Progress dashboard in EyeSpy AI to create a polished, aesthetically pleasing interface that matches the app's dark fitness theme and improves user experience.
</task>

<context>
The EyeSpy AI app has a dark fitness-themed design with:
- Dark blue to black gradient backgrounds
- Modern, tech-forward aesthetic focusing on precision and safety
- Clean card-based layouts with subtle shadows
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Professional appearance suitable for fitness tracking

The current Exercise Progress dashboard has several UI issues:
- Harsh blue background on "Exercise Progress" header that clashes with dark theme
- Poor color contrast and readability
- Inconsistent styling with rest of the application
- Unprofessional appearance that breaks visual flow
- Colors that are not easy on the eyes for extended viewing
</context>

<methodology>
1. Analyze current progress dashboard styling and identify specific color/design issues
2. Match the design patterns used in existing components (exercise cards, main interface)
3. Apply consistent dark theme color palette throughout progress section
4. Improve visual hierarchy with proper typography and spacing
5. Ensure excellent contrast ratios for accessibility
6. Add subtle visual enhancements for professional appearance
</methodology>

<current_issues>
Visual problems to fix:
- "Exercise Progress" header has harsh blue background that doesn't match app theme
- Poor contrast between text and background colors
- Inconsistent card styling compared to exercise selection cards
- Missing visual polish and professional finish
- Colors strain the eyes instead of being comfortable for extended viewing
- Overall design breaks the visual consistency of the dark fitness theme
</current_issues>

<examples>
<example>
<input>Current: Blue header background with "Exercise Progress" text</input>
<o>
Fixed: Dark gradient background matching main app theme, elegant typography with proper contrast, subtle glow effects consistent with fitness branding
</o>
</example>

<example>
<input>Current: Statistics cards with poor color scheme</input>
<o>
Fixed: Dark card backgrounds with subtle borders, proper text contrast, consistent with exercise selection cards, hover effects for interactivity
</o>
</example>
</examples>

<thinking>
Before implementing changes, consider:
1. What specific color values and gradients are used in the existing exercise selection cards?
2. How can I maintain the tech-forward, AI-focused fitness theme throughout the progress section?
3. What typography hierarchy will improve readability while looking professional?
4. How do I ensure the progress dashboard feels integrated with the rest of the app?
5. What subtle animations or effects would enhance the user experience?
6. How can I make the data visualization more engaging while keeping it readable?

## UI Enhancement Requirements

### Color Scheme Fixes
- Replace harsh blue header background with dark gradient matching main app theme
- Use dark card backgrounds (dark blue/gray) with subtle transparency
- Implement proper white/light text on dark backgrounds for optimal contrast
- Add subtle accent colors (blues/teals) for highlights and emphasis only
- Ensure all colors pass WCAG accessibility contrast requirements

### Typography and Layout
- Use consistent font weights and sizes matching existing components
- Implement proper visual hierarchy (large titles, medium subtitles, small details)
- Add adequate spacing between elements for comfortable reading
- Align text properly within cards and sections

### Card Design Consistency
- Match exercise selection card styling (same shadow, border radius, padding)
- Use consistent hover effects and transitions
- Maintain same card dimensions and spacing patterns
- Apply same background colors and opacity levels

### Professional Polish
- Add subtle glow effects or borders consistent with fitness theme
- Implement smooth transitions for interactive elements
- Use consistent iconography and spacing
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is maintained

### Specific Component Updates
Target these files for styling improvements:
- Progress dashboard component CSS/styling
- Exercise progress cards
- Session history section
- Statistics display areas

### Design Principles to Follow
