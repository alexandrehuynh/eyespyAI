Fix MediaPipe production import and camera permission timing issues

CRITICAL BUG FIX 1 - MEDIAPIPE PRODUCTION IMPORT:

REPLACE DYNAMIC IMPORT WITH STATIC IMPORT:
- Remove: const { Pose } = await import('@mediapipe/pose');
- Replace with: import { Pose } from '@mediapipe/pose'; at top of PoseOverlay.tsx file
- Move Pose initialization inside useEffect but remove dynamic import
- Wrap Pose constructor in try-catch with detailed error logging

ENSURE CONSISTENT ASSET LOADING:
- Verify all MediaPipe assets load from same source (CDN vs local)
- Add error handling for asset loading failures
- Consider using exact version numbers instead of latest

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IF STATIC IMPORT FAILS:
- Try: const mediapipe = await import('@mediapipe/pose'); then const pose = new mediapipe.Pose(...)
- Or: Use require() instead of import() for better build compatibility

CRITICAL BUG FIX 2 - CAMERA PERMISSION TIMING:

MOVE CAMERA ENUMERATION AFTER PERMISSIONS:
- Remove camera enumeration useEffect from AnalysisInterface.tsx component mount
- Move enumerateDevices() call to AFTER getUserMedia() succeeds in CameraView.tsx
- Add callback from CameraView to AnalysisInterface to update available cameras
- Set initial currentCameraId to empty string, populate after camera starts

UPDATE CAMERAVIEW TO HANDLE ENUMERATION:
- Add onCamerasEnumerated prop to CameraView interface
- After successful getUserMedia, call enumerateDevices() and notify parent
- Pass available cameras back to AnalysisInterface through callback
- Handle case where no cameras found gracefully

FIX CAMERA SWITCHING FLOW:
- Ensure camera list is populated before toggle buttons work
- Add loading state for camera enumeration
- Disable toggle button until cameras are enumerated
- Default to front camera initially, then populate full list

COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING:
- Add detailed logging for both MediaPipe and camera issues
- Show user-friendly error messages for each failure type
- Graceful degradation if either system fails

RESULT: Fix both the MediaPipe "c is not a constructor" production error AND the camera permission timing issue that causes back camera toggle to fail initially.
