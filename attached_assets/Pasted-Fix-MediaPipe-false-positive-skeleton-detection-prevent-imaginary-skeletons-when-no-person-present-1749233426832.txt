Fix MediaPipe false positive skeleton detection - prevent imaginary skeletons when no person present
PHANTOM SKELETON DETECTION ISSUE:

Skeleton landmarks appear when no person is in frame on certain camera/orientation combinations
Front camera portrait mode shows imaginary skeleton when empty
Back camera shows imaginary skeletons in both portrait and landscape when empty
Individual landmark visibility checks are insufficient for person detection validation

ADD ROBUST PERSON DETECTION VALIDATION:

Implement comprehensive person detection check before drawing any landmarks or connections
Require minimum number of key body landmarks to be simultaneously visible (at least 6-8 key points)
Add landmark coherence validation to ensure landmarks form reasonable human body structure
Check that landmarks are distributed across expected body regions not clustered randomly

ENHANCE LANDMARK VALIDATION LOGIC:

Require core body landmarks (shoulders, hips, major joints) to be detected together
Add positional relationship validation between key landmarks (shoulders above hips, reasonable distances)
Implement landmark cluster analysis to detect if points form coherent human pose vs random scattered points
Add minimum confidence threshold for overall pose detection not just individual landmarks

CAMERA-SPECIFIC DETECTION ADJUSTMENTS:

Add different confidence thresholds for front vs back camera due to lighting differences
Implement orientation-specific validation since portrait vs landscape may have different detection patterns
Add background stability check to avoid false detections from shadows or objects
Consider environmental factors that might cause phantom detections

IMPROVE DRAWING CONDITIONAL LOGIC:

Only draw landmarks and connections if comprehensive person validation passes
Add early return if insufficient key landmarks detected
Implement pose coherence score calculation before rendering
Ensure consistent person detection logic across all camera and orientation combinations

ADD DETECTION QUALITY VALIDATION:

Calculate pose coherence score based on landmark relationships and positions
Require minimum body coverage percentage before drawing skeleton
Add temporal consistency check to avoid single-frame false positives
Implement landmark position reasonableness validation

RESULT: Eliminate phantom skeleton appearances when no person is present while maintaining accurate detection when person is in frame across all camera and orientation combinations.
