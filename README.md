## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexandrehuynh/eyespyAI.git
cd eyespyAI
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Database
```bash
# Option A: Use unified services (recommended)
./start-unified.sh

# Option B: Manual setup with unified services
cd ../unified-services
docker-compose up -d postgres
docker exec main-postgres createdb -U postgres eyespyai
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables
```bash
# For development with unified services
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/eyespyai"
export SESSION_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
export NODE_ENV="development"
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 6. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Development with Unified Services
The application is configured to work with the unified PostgreSQL service. No `.env` file is needed for basic setup.

### Manual Environment Variables
For custom configurations, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Database Configuration (unified services)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/eyespyai"

# Session Secret
export SESSION_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Environment
export NODE_ENV="development"
```

### Docker Compose
EyeSpyAI is integrated into the unified services Docker Compose setup:

```bash
cd ../unified-services
docker-compose up -d eyespyai
```

## üì± Usage

1. **Register/Login**: Create an account or sign in to your existing account
2. **Select Exercise**: Choose from squats, push-ups, or lunges
3. **Camera Setup**: Allow camera access and position yourself in frame
4. **Start Workout**: Begin your exercise session
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Receive instant form corrections and guidance
6. **Track Progress**: View your workout history and improvement over time

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:

- **users**: User accounts and authentication
- **exercise_sessions**: Workout session tracking
- **exercise_metrics**: Real-time form measurements
- **user_progress**: Aggregated performance statistics
- **auth_tokens**: Password reset and magic link tokens

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Using Unified Services (Recommended)
```bash
# Start all services including EyeSpyAI
cd ../unified-services
docker-compose up -d

# Start only EyeSpyAI
docker-compose up -d eyespyai

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f eyespyai

# Stop services
docker-compose stop eyespyai
```

### Standalone Docker Build
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t eyespyai .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@host.docker.internal:5432/eyespyai" \
  -e SESSION_SECRET="your-secret-key" \
  eyespyai
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Environment Variables for Production
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Use a secure `SESSION_SECRET`
- Configure production `DATABASE_URL`
- Enable HTTPS for secure cookies
