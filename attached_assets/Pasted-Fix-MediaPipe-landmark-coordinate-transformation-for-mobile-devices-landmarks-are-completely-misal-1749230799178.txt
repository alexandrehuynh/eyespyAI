Fix MediaPipe landmark coordinate transformation for mobile devices - landmarks are completely misaligned

CRITICAL COORDINATE MAPPING ISSUE ON MOBILE:
- MediaPipe landmarks work perfectly on desktop but are severely misaligned on mobile
- Landmarks appear in wrong locations instead of following the body
- Issue affects both front/back cameras and portrait/landscape modes
- Problem is in coordinate transformation logic in PoseOverlay transformLandmark function

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- Current code assumes video is always 16:9 aspect ratio but mobile cameras may differ
- Coordinate transformation only handles portrait mode, missing landscape logic  
- Mobile video streams may have different coordinate systems than desktop
- Canvas sizing may not match actual video dimensions on mobile

FIXES NEEDED IN POSEOVERLAY TRANSFORMLANDMARK FUNCTION:

DETECT ACTUAL VIDEO DIMENSIONS:
- Remove hardcoded 16:9 aspect ratio assumption
- Get actual video element dimensions using videoElement.videoWidth and videoElement.videoHeight
- Calculate real aspect ratio from actual video stream dimensions
- Use getBoundingClientRect for displayed video size

ADD LANDSCAPE MODE COORDINATE TRANSFORMATION:
- Currently only portrait mode has coordinate transformation logic
- Add corresponding transformation logic for landscape mode on mobile
- Handle coordinate mapping for landscape orientation properly

IMPROVE MOBILE CAMERA HANDLING:
- Add mobile device detection to apply different coordinate logic if needed
- Handle potential camera stream rotation or different coordinate systems
- Account for mobile browser differences in video rendering

ENHANCED DEBUGGING:
- Add console logging for video dimensions, canvas dimensions, and coordinate calculations
- Log actual vs expected aspect ratios
- Add mobile-specific debug information

ENSURE PROPER CANVAS SIZING:
- Verify canvas dimensions match displayed video element exactly
- Handle mobile viewport and device pixel ratio considerations
- Account for CSS object-cover behavior differences on mobile

RESULT: Fix severely misaligned MediaPipe landmarks on mobile devices so pose detection works accurately across all devices and orientations.
