Improve squat and push-up rep detection accuracy and timing - too strict thresholds causing missed reps

REP COUNTING ISSUES FOR BOTH EXERCISES:
- Rep detection thresholds too restrictive causing missed valid reps
- Reps counted at wrong timing during transitions instead of movement completion
- Position stability requirements too strict for natural movement variations
- Height-based detection unreliable across different camera angles and positions

IMPROVE SQUAT REP DETECTION LOGIC:
- Relax knee angle thresholds from current restrictive ranges to more realistic values
- Replace hip height dependency with knee position relative to ankle for camera angle independence
- Use knee-to-hip angle changes as primary detection method instead of absolute heights
- Add movement velocity tracking to detect direction changes for proper timing
- Count reps at movement completion points not during transitions
- Extend position stability frames for more reliable detection while allowing natural movement

IMPROVE PUSH-UP REP DETECTION LOGIC:
- Relax elbow angle thresholds from current restrictive ranges to more realistic values
- Replace shoulder height dependency with elbow position relative to shoulder for camera angle independence
- Use shoulder-to-elbow angle changes as primary detection method instead of absolute heights
- Add movement velocity tracking to detect direction changes for proper timing
- Apply same completion-point counting logic as improved squat detection

UNIVERSAL REP COUNTING IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add movement velocity detection to identify when person stops moving in each direction
- Implement smoother state transitions with hysteresis to prevent false triggers
- Require minimum movement range before counting rep but make ranges more realistic
- Add maximum time limits for each phase to prevent position holding
- Fix timing so reps count at proper completion not during movement transitions

ENHANCED MOVEMENT VALIDATION:
- Replace absolute measurements with relative joint positioning for camera angle flexibility
- Use joint angle changes and distances for more reliable detection across positions
- Ensure consistent movement validation logic between squat and push-up exercises
- Add proper movement direction detection using angle velocity changes

RESULT: More accurate and responsive rep detection for both squat and push-up exercises with proper timing and realistic thresholds while maintaining form quality standards.
